# MCLP
Demo of the Cross Entropy Method for the Maximal Covering Location Problem
The newly added program for the Maximal Covering Location Problem is an example of an Instance with 500 nodes.

1. Instance datasets also see http://www.lac.inpe.br/~lorena/instancias.html SJC500.dat, where the coordinate of 500 nodes and the corresponding demands are also listed.
2. SJC500.txt is formulated with nodes number in the first line. From the second line the euclidean coordinates are listed in the first two columns, and demands in the third columns.
3. Run the MaxCoveringLocationProblem.exe in the same folder of SJC500.txt, the console output the results of instance SJC500 with facility number=3, and covering radius =800.
4. The coverage rate is calculated to be 78.82%, with object 15730, and the runtime (for reference only) the same as the results in the corresponding article in the SJC datasets table.
