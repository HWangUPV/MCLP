The Cross Entropy Method for the Maximal Covering Location Problem
The newly added program for the Maximal Covering Location Problem is an example of an Instance with 500 nodes.

1. Instance datasets also see http://www.lac.inpe.br/~lorena/instancias.html SJC500.dat, where the coordinate of 500 nodes and the corresponding demands are also listed.
