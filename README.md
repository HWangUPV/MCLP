# Cross Entropy Method for the Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP)
The Cross Entropy Method for the Maximal Covering Location Problem

All data involved in this work are attached and Ziped (see, MCLP_Benchmark_Instances.zip). It includes benchmark instances of 8 popular data sets, including random sets GR , Beasley , ZDS, PCB , real-world sets SJC, and Maximo, as well as benchmark data sets BDS and extended data BDS1000 for the asymmetric MCLP.

Some of the original data links are also available at the website http://www.lac.inpe.br/~lorena/instancias.html (SJC), http://www.https://sites.google.com/site/nascimentomcv/downloads/mclp (Maximo), https://github.com/fabiofurini/LocationCovering (BDS).
